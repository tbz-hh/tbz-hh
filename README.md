Hi, Iâ€™m @tbz-hh, just an engineering student trying to teach himself how to build
- I always told myself I'm going to deploy an app someday, and I kept on waiting for that day to happen. now I realized that day could be now.
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to build web applications.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything cool.
